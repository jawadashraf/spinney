# Project Kickoff & UAT Checklist

This document outlines the first 14 days after project approval. Showing this to the client demonstrates high professional preparedness.

## Phase 1: Kickoff (Days 1–3)
- [ ] **Stakeholder Workshop:** Final validation of user roles (Frontline, Safeguarding, etc.).
- [ ] **Environment Setup:** Provisioning the secure Laravel 12 environment.
- [ ] **Data Governance Briefing:** Reviewing GDPR and data storage protocols with your Safeguarding Lead.

## Phase 2: Early Access & Feedback (Days 4–10)
- [ ] **Enquiry Module Demo:** Reviewing the "Front Door" intake screens.
- [ ] **Service User Profile Review:** Confirming fields for faith and cultural sensitivity.
- [ ] **Note Visibility Testing:** Verifying that restricted notes are indeed restricted.

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Criteria
To ensure the system meets your needs, we will test the following with your team:
1.  **Can a frontline worker log a new phone enquiry in under 60 seconds?**
2.  **Can a Safeguarding Lead see a flag that a practitioner cannot see?**
3.  **Can a practitioner view the complete history of a client across different teams?**
4.  **Can an Admin export a report of last month’s enquiries for a funding board?**
