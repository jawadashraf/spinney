# Project Proposal: Spinney Hill Integrated CRM (Phase 1)

## 1. Executive Summary
Spinney Hill provides critical community support services that are currently hindered by paper-based, disconnected systems. This proposal outlines the development of a secure, integrated, and modern CRM system—the **Spinney Hill Digital Backbone**. 

This platform will unify frontline enquiries, case management, safeguarding, and donor relations into a single source of truth, enabling the team to focus on what matters most: **impact and recovery**.

## 2. The Challenge
*   **Paper-Based Risks:** Inefficiencies in data capture and potential safeguarding gaps.
*   **Disconnected Data:** Difficulty in tracking long-term service user journeys across multiple teams.
*   **Reporting Overhead:** Manual effort required for funding and governance reports.

## 3. Our Solution: The Digital Backbone
Built on the industry-leading **Laravel 12** and **Filament 4** frameworks, the CRM will provide:
*   **Integrated Intake:** A "Front Door" for all telephone and walk-in enquiries.
*   **Unified Case Files:** Shared records for practitioners (D&A, Counselling, Outreach).
*   **Safeguarding First:** Role-based access and restricted sensitive notes.
*   **Community Impact:** Streamlined reporting for funders and stakeholders.

## 4. Key Value Proposition
1.  **Security & Compliance:** GDPR-compliant by design with full audit trails.
2.  **Scalability:** Modern tech stack that grows with the organisation.
3.  **Efficiency:** Significant reduction in administrative burden for staff.
4.  **Dignified Support:** Service users experience joined-up care, not repeated assessments.
